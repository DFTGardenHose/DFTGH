### This is a website designed for a Podcast ("Drinking from the Garden Hose").  Features some animated CSS in the podcast title and in some other areas.  Javascript is used to handle clicks on pictures (which causes them to spin) and if you click on text under the podcasters pictures, it will play real audio clips from the podcast...pictures will spin while the audio is playing.
